    <h1>Polish Noodles</h1>
    <img src="/images/polish noodles.jpeg" alt="delicious polish noodles">
    <h2>Description </h2>
    <p>This simple recipe came from the Polish side of my family. We simply called it 'cottage cheese and noodles' or 'lazy man pierogies.' It's a great comfort food and can be made with any kind of noodle. It could be a side dish, but we always enjoyed it as a meal.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup butter</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package egg noodles</li>
        <li>1 small onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package cottage cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup sour cream
        </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon sea salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in melted butter until softened, 7 to 10 minutes.

        </li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain and return to the pot.

        </li>
        <li>Stir butter and onion mixture, cottage cheese, sour cream, sea salt, and black pepper into the noodles. Place the pot over medium heat; cook and stir until heated through and warm, 5 to 8 minutes.</li>
